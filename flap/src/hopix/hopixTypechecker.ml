     [typecheck tenv p] returns the typing environment
     augmented with the variables defined by the program.

     We first check that [p] is fully annotated. Then,
     the algorithm is meant to check that annotation are
     consistent.

     For programs and definitions, the algorithm is a straightforward
     traversal of the abstract syntax tree. Each node of the abstract
     syntax tree is locally checked for welltypedness: indeed, there
     is exactly one typing rule per syntactic construction and this
     rule only requires the subexpressions have been recursively
     checked.

     For expressions, things are a bit more complicated since some
     nodes of the abstract syntax tree do not carry a type annotation.
     For these nodes, we do not *check* that the expression has some
     type but we *compute* a type instead. Therefore, we must
     implement two mutually recursive functions: one that checks if an
     input expression has a specific type (in that case, the
     expression and the type are inputs) and another one which compute
     a type for a given expression (in that casse, the expression is
     the input and the type is the output).

      returns a substitution equivalent to [c] if [c] is
      satisfiable and has a unique ground solution. Otherwise, a
      type error message is issued.

      The solving process is based on first-order unification.
      (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science))

      The first-order unification algorithm rewrites the type
      equalities using 6 simplification rules (described below) as
      long as possible. Once finished, this rewriting process leads
      to three situations:

      1. The type equalities are of the form [∧ᵢ Xᵢ = Tᵢ],
         this form also encodes a substitution (which may or
         may not be ground).

         Also, ∀i j, Xᵢ ∉ FV(Tⱼ).

         (Be careful, this does not mean that the resulting substitution
          is ground...)

      2. The type equalities are inconsistent (written ⊥).
         (The program is ill-typed.)

      3. The type equalities contain a cycle.
         (The program is also ill-typed.)

      Here are the 6 simplification rules that must be used to
      simplify the initial constraint:

      - [delete]

                        c = (t, t) :: c' ———–→ c'

        If an equality simply says that a type is equal to itself,
        it can be removed since it is not informative.

      - [decompose]

          c = (TyCon (a, tys1) = TyCon (a, tys2)) :: c' ———–→ tys1 = tys2 @ c'

        Two types made from the same type constructors are equal if and
        only if their arguments are equal.

      - [conflict]

                c = (TyCon (a, tys1) = TyCon (b, tys2)) :: c' ———–→ ⊥

        Two types made from distinct type constructors are equal is an
        inconsistency: the constraint is equivalent to ⊥.

      - [swap]

       c = (TyCon (a, ts) = TyVar x) :: c' ———–→ (TyVar x = TyCon (a, ts) :: c'

        We orient equalities to have equalities of the form X = T in the end.

      - [eliminate]

                c = (TyVar x = t) :: c' ———–→ (TyVar x = t) :: c' { TyVar x ↦ t }

        Once we know that [x] is equal to [T], every occurence of [x] in other
        equalities can be removed.

       - [occur-check]

                c = (TyVar x = TyCon (a, ts)) :: c' ———–→ ⊥     if x ∈ FV(ts)

        The equalities encode a cycle: the constraint is not
        satisfiable in the model of trees (and our types are syntactic
        representatives of this model).

      To implement the solver, you can either:

      - implement the 6 simplification rules and a function that goes
        through the list of equalities to apply them *in the right
        order*, you will get a naive but sound algorithm ;

      - or, you can implement a more sophisticated algorithm as described in
            Franz Baader and Tobias Nipkow,
            Term Rewriting and All That. Cambridge University Press, 1998.
        This algorithm is based on the UnionFind data structures and offers
        a linear complexity thanks to an optimisation of the [eliminate]
        simplification rule.
